# Workshop on Human Values at PDC’12

On Sunday 12th of August a workshop on **Human Values within Participatory Design** was given during PDC’12 (Participatory Design Conference, Roskilde, Denmark). For a whole day long, approx. 24 people exchanged their experiences with the topic and develloped an approach for a specific case study. Although ‘being human’ is always a main aspect of Participatory Design in general, a specific focus on Human Values leads to interesting discussions and valuable outcomes. Especially when inclusion is one of the goals…

I have presented my **cultural probes** (FOOD RELATED) and the **picnic-quiz** (NIVA TO NENETS) during this workshop day. Later this week I will present a short paper about **artistic participatory practices**.
