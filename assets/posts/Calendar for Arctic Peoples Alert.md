# Calendar for Arctic Peoples Alert

A calendar of the year 2013 has been made for **Arctic Peoples Alert**, in which images of historical maps of the Nenets region are combined with pictures that I made in November 2012. The first page of this project explains the ***NIVA TO NENETS*** project in three languages: Dutch, English and Russian.

**Arctic Peoples Alert** is the Dutch non-governmental human rights organization standing up for the interest of indigenous Arctic peoples in the countries around the North Pole. Every year a calendar like this is send to donators… So help them helping them, and help yourself in the meantime with one of these nice calendars!
