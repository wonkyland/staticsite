Proudly showing my picnic blanket in Ittoqqortoormiit, East Greenland…

During a short stay in this lovely village I have added a seal made from local seal skin. Seal can be seen as the Greenlanders’ ‘daily bread’. If you notice how seals live a good life before they got shot to be eaten, it is almost impossible to feel sorry for them. They are very appreciated for their rich and healthy taste, and for their beautiful skin!
