# Representing Reindeer

Reindeer fascinate me. The beauty of their antlers, the sounds they make, their stocky appearance compared to other deer, the uniqueness of their fur, their smell: I am a big fan!!! As I am also fascinated by their imagery, I am initiating a project that focuses on the representation of reindeer. At a time that we long for rewilding, how do we cope with the image of cute cuddly reindeer? What exactly makes a reindeer a reindeer, in essence or in spirit? Can we identify that without anthropomorphism, and can we keep this identification intact during representation?

This new project is still in its infancy, and I have not yet decided how to continue or what could become the end result. As a first step, I collect cuddly reindeer from flee-markets and second-hand shops and photograph them.
