# Guest lessons in Naryan Mar

During the last week of October I gave several guest lessons at the Naryan-Mar Socio-Humanitarian College in the Northwest of Russia (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nmsgc.org">www.nmsgc.org</a>). I lectured not only about the ***NIVA TO NENETS*** project and the ***FOOD RELATED*** project, but also about Belgium and the Netherlands, and about the social function of art. After one of my presentations, the students wanted to make a group picture with my picnic blanket.

I made small **creative questionnaires** about the Lada Niva for these students, because I was curious to learn about their feelings for this car. So after my presentations the students filled in the booklets, which were handed out together with small Niva’s made from Belgian chocolate.
