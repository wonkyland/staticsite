During a working period as artist in residence at **Danish Art Workshops** in Copenhagen, I  discussed some aspects of my interactive roadmovie **NIVA TO NENETS** within the format of a picnic-quiz. I asked the participating people five questions, after which they positioned themselves on the picnic-blanket that resembled the answer of their choice. While matching snacks were served, some interesting discussions on paradoxical aspects of bringing help occured. It was a joyful and inspirational afternoon. This was my second time to give such a picnic-quiz and I am very happy with how it went!

The **Arctic Council Indigenous Peoples Secreatariat** wrote a nice article about this event: <a href="http://www.arcticpeoples.org/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=498:indigenous-day-tribute&Itemid=2" target="_blank">http://www.arcticpeoples.org/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=498:indigenous-day-tribute&Itemid=2</a>

And so did **Danish Art Workshops**: <a href="http://svfk.dk/dk/Service/Nyheder/picnicdebat" target="_blank">http://svfk.dk/dk/Service/Nyheder/picnicdebat</a> (only in Danishâ€¦)
