# A short visit to a Nenets chum on the tundra

During my first visit to Naryan Mar and Krasnoye for the NIVA TO NENETS project, I had the possibility to travel to some Nenets on the tundra. This was only for a very short visit. I was flashed into a traditional reindeer herding livelihood, and absorbed every second with great joy and appreciationâ€¦ resulting in hours of remembrance. The herders were friendly and welcoming. When I was notified that it was already time to travel back to the car, my whole body seemed to protest and wished to stay. But on the sledge pulled by reindeer all my muscles were filled with joy again!

I made much more photographs during this short visit. Some can be found in a Facebook album: <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/c4fvuyg">http://tinyurl.com/c4fvuyg</a>
