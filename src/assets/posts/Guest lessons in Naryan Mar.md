# Guest lessons in Naryan Mar

During the last week of October I gave several guest lessons at the Naryan-Mar Socio-Humanitarian College in the Northwest of Russia (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nmsgc.org">www.nmsgc.org</a>). I lectured not only about the ***NIVA TO NENETS*** project and the ***FOOD RELATED*** project, but also about Belgium and the Netherlands, and about the social function of art. After one of my presentations, the students wanted to make a group picture with my picnic blanket.

I made small **creative questionnaires** about the Lada Niva for these students, because I was curious to learn about their feelings for this car. So after my presentations the students filled in the booklets, which were handed out together with small Nivaâ€™s made from Belgian chocolate.
