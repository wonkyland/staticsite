# Doctoral Thesis

Hurrah! My thesis has been accepted! After many hours of printing, folding, sewing (by hand and with a sewing machine), cutting and glueing, I have ten packages ready to be send in. Each thesis-package contains five maps (or chapters), a booklet with notes, a reference list and a summary. The maps include stickers, fold-outs, postcards and fabric. Realising how time-consuming it was to craft these thesissen, I almost wished I had gone for a more conventional design. But the end result matches my probing approach very well and I am happy with the look and feel.

A pdf-version of this thesis can be downloaded on the thesis-page (top-menu). However, reading a physical, hand-made version is preferable. Contact me in case in wish to obtain one; Iâ€™ll probably make some more in the nearby future ;-).
