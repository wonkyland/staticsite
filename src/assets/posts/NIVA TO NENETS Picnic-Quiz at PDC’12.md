# NIVA TO NENETS Picnic-Quiz at PDCâ€™12

The ***NIVA TO NENETS*** project was presented at the **Participatory Design Conference** in Roskilde in a paper presentation, but also during a **Picnic-Quiz**. In three questions I asked the motivated group of participants about their opinion and concerns related to some side-effects of bringing help to an indigenous people (specifically the Nenets, a semi-nomadic reindeer herding people in the northwest of the Russian Federation). The answers to the quiz-questions were connected to colourful picnic-blankets with matching picnic-snacks.
